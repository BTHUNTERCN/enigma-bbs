# MCI Codes

## Introduction
ENiGMA½ supports a variety of MCI codes. Some **predefined** codes produce information about the current user, system, or other statistics while others are used to instanciate a **View**. MCI codes are two characters in length and are prefixed with a percent (%) symbol. Some MCI codes have additional options that may be set directly from the code itself while others -- and more advanced options -- are controlled via the current theme. Standard (non-focus) and focus colors are set by placing duplicate codes back to back in art files.

## Views
A **View** is a control placed on a **form** that can display variable data or collect input. One example of a View is a Vertical Menu (`%VM`): Oldschool BBSers may recognize this as a lightbar menu.

### Available Views
* Text Label (`TL`): Displays text
* Edit Text (`ET`): Collect user input
* Masked Edit Text (`ME`): Collect user input using a *mask*
* Multi Line Text Edit (`MT`): Multi line edit control
* Button (`BT`): A button
* Vertical Menu (`VM`): A vertical menu aka a vertical lightbar
* Horizontal Menu (`HM`): A horizontal menu aka a horizontal lightbar
* Spinner Menu (`SM`): A spinner input control
* Toggle Menu (`TM`): A toggle menu commonly used for Yes/No style input
* Key Entry (`KE`): A *single* key input control

(Peek at `core/mci_view_factory.js` to see additional information on these)

## Predefined
There are many predefined MCI codes that can be used anywhere on the system (placed in any art file). More are added all the time so also check out `core/predefined_mci.js` for a full listing. Many codes attempt to pay homage to Oblivion/2, iNiQUiTY, etc.

## Properties & Theming
Predefined MCI codes and other Views can have properties set via `menu.hjson` and further *themed* via `theme.hjson`.

### Common Properties
* `textStyle`: Sets the standard (non-focus) text style. See **Text Styles** below
* `focusTextStyle`: Sets focus text style. See **Text Styles** below.
* `itemSpacing`: Used to separate items in menus such as Vertical Menu and Horizontal Menu Views.
* `height`: Sets the height of views such as menus that may be > 1 character in height
* `width`: Sets the width of a view
* `focus`: If set to `true`, establishes initial focus
* `text`: (initial) text of a view
* `submit`: If set to `true` any `accept` action upon this view will submit the encompassing **form**

These are just a few of the properties set on various views. *Use the source Luke*, as well as taking a look at the default `menu.hjson` and `theme.hjson` files!
