ENiGMAÂ½ comes with a built in *content server* for supporting both HTTP and HTTPS. Currently the [File Bases](file_base.md) registers routes for file downloads, and static files can also be served for your BBS. Other features will likely come in the future or you can easily write your own!

# Configuration
By default the web server is not enabled. To enable it, you will need to at a minimum configure two keys in the `contentServers.web` section of `config.hjson`:

```hjson
contentServers: {
	web: {
		domain: bbs.yourdomain.com

		http: {
			enabled: true
			port: 8080
		}
	}
}
```

The following is a table of all configuration keys available under `contentServers.web`:
| Key | Required | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `domain` | :+1: | Sets the domain, e.g. `bbs.yourdomain.com`. |
| `http` | :-1: | Sub configuration for HTTP (non-secure) connections. See **HTTP Configuration** below. |
| `overrideUrlPrefix` | :-1: | Instructs the system to be explicit when handing out URLs. Useful if your server is behind a transparent proxy. |

### HTTP Configuration
Entries available under `contentServers.web.http`:

| Key | Required | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `enable` | :+1: | Set to `true` to enable this server.
| `port` | :-1: | Override the default port of `8080`. |
| `address` | :-1: | Sets an explicit bind address. |

### HTTPS Configuration
Entries available under `contentServers.web.htt2`:

| Key | Required | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `enable` | :+1: | Set to `true` to enable this server.
| `port` | :-1: | Override the default port of `8080`. |
| `address` | :-1: | Sets an explicit bind address. |
| `certPem` | :+1: | Overrides the default certificate path of `/config/https_cert.pem`. Certificate must be in PEM format. See **Certificates** below. |
| `keyPem` | :+1: | Overrides the default certificate key path of `/config/https_cert_key.pem`. Key must be in PEM format. See **Certificates** below. |

#### Certificates
If you don't have a TLS certificate for your domain, a good source for a certificate can be [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) who supplies free and trusted TLS certificates.

## Static Routes
Static files live relative to the `contentServers.web.staticRoot` path which defaults to `enigma-bbs/www`.

## Custom Error Pages
Customized error pages can be created for [HTTP error codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#4xx_Client_Error) by providing a `<error_code>.html` file in the *static routes* area. For example: `404.html`.
